# MoonQuake

## SUMMARY
    When they explored the Moon, NASA’s Apollo astronauts left behind several instruments to collect geophysical data near each Apollo landing site. Your challenge is to develop an app for the public that plots the seismic data these instruments transmitted back to Earth on an interactive 3-D digital moon globe.

## BACKGROUND
    Astronauts left several Passive Seismic Experiments (PSE) on the lunar surface during the Apollo missions. These instruments were designed to monitor the environment of each Apollo landing site for at least a year after the astronauts departed. Two different types of PSE packages were set up: Apollo 11 astronauts deployed Early Apollo Surface Experiments Package (EASEP) units pictured in Figure 1 below, and astronauts on the Apollo 12, 14, 15, and 16 missions deployed the more advanced Apollo Lunar Surface Experiments Package (ALSEP) units shown in Figure 2. The seismometers on these devices detected moonquakes, impacts from meteorites, and impacts of man-made origin (also known as artificial impacts), and transmitted the data to Earth where it is still available for use today. Newly updated lunar seismic data curated in NASA’s Planetary Data System is available that includes date, time, latitude, longitude, magnitude, and depth, along with data descriptions and software to help users read the data. Numerous moonquakes occur during sunset and sunrise when the lunar surface temperature changes rapidly on either side of the day/night terminator line. Many of those moonquakes even occur on mapped fault lines.
